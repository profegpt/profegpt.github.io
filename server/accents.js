/**
 * Finding the word someone meant when they left the accents off.
 *
 * Students type *jamon*, and *jamón* is what the dictionary has. Neither the
 * RAE nor the Wiktionnaire will match without the accent, so a perfectly
 * ordinary vocabulary question came back as "not found" when the dictionary
 * knew the word all along.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately narrow. It only runs when the word as typed was
 * **not found at all**, and it only accepts a candidate that is the same word
 * once accents are stripped. So *bebe* is never quietly turned into *bebé* —
 * both are words, so the first lookup succeeds and this never runs — and
 * *jamon* is never turned into *jabón*, which is a different word rather than
 * the same one spelled carelessly.
