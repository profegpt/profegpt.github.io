/**
 * DeepL: a real translation engine, and the best one here for French.
 *
 * It is what Lingva was supposed to be — accurate, dedicated, and answering to
 * a published contract rather than to whether Google feels like serving a
 * volunteer's proxy today. The free tier is 500,000 characters a month, which a
 * class typing sentences will not come close to spending.
 *
 * It goes above the model because it is better at the job and cheaper to ask:
 * a specialist translator, deterministic, with no habit of explaining itself
 * and no daily request cap to exhaust by lunchtime.
 *
 * **It has no Latin.** Nothing does, among dedicated engines — Latin is why the
 * model is in the chain at all. So this declines Latin by name and the model
 * takes it, which is the one place a model is not merely the best option but
 * the only one.
