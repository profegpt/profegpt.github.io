/**
 * Pronunciation, from ElevenLabs.
 *
 * A dictionary that cannot say the word out loud is half a dictionary for
 * anybody learning to speak, and the three languages here are exactly the ones
 * where spelling does not tell you the sound: *chaleureux*, *corazón*,
 * *puella*.
 *
 * The budget is the shape of this feature. The free tier is **10,000
 * characters a month** for the whole site — about a thousand headwords — and
 * there is no per-user metering to hide behind. So:
 *
 *   - only single words are spoken, never sentences;
 *   - every clip is cached by word and voice, so a class of twenty-five all
 *     looking up *chaleureux* spends ten characters once, not two hundred and
 *     fifty;
 *   - and when the month runs out the button says so plainly rather than
 *     failing silently, because a study aid that quietly stops working is
 *     worse than one that admits it.
